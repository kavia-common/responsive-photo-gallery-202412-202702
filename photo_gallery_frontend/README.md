# Photo Gallery Frontend (React)

A beginner-level responsive photo gallery:
- Responsive image grid
- Click an image to open a modal viewer
- Keyboard support: `Esc` closes, `←/→` navigate

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app uses `REACT_APP_PORT` (default: `3000`) as configured in `.env`.
